# Specification Quality Checklist: RPi3 Hardware Bringup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a hardware bringup spec, not a user-facing feature. "Users" = kernel developers.
- Acceptance scenarios are written for serial console interaction testing on real hardware.
- All assumptions about U-Boot, TFTP, SD card layout are documented in the Assumptions section.
